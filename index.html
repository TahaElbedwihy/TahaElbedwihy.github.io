        <h1> Projects </h1>
        <p>
          Creating websites is not as easy as it looks. You may have landed on websites that blew your mind like Apple's
          when you scroll and the photo of the phone moves, and you may have also seen your local coffee shop's website
          and were enraged by the non-user friendly interface. All it takes is time to get better at developing websites,
          this one your on now may look decent but this isn't my first website, and it definitely won't be my last.

        <h1> Who I Am </h1>
        <p>
          As a student who attends New Jersey Institute of Technology, I am currently getting my B.S in Business Information
          Systems as I didn't see myself as a computer scientist. At first I thought that a computer scientist was
          the only possible career in tech, but as I grew up and researched other fields, I was happy to choose BIS.
