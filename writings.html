          Linux Tutorial
        </h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Linux is an open source operating system. You can find Linux in a Windows or Mac computer. In Windows, Linux
          is found in the command prompt, and in MAC OS it is found in terminal. This open source program was created by
          Linus Torvalds for people to use for practically any project. Most people get confused that Linux is an operating
          system when it's not, it's the kernel that the operating system runs on. A kernel is the core of a computer's
          operating system that controls everything in that system.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <div class="writings_definitions">
            <li><h4> vi </h4></li>
            <p> Able to read commands. Vi is referred to as a screen editor. To use vi, simply input vi (file name)
              this will open up the file and you will be able to begin doing commits.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> cd </h4></li>
            <p> Stands for "change directory". After cd, the user puts in which file he wants to go into. For example,
              cd Desktop will change the directory from the current one to another directory. This can only work going
              forward, you cannot be in a folder in the desktop and try to change the directory to the actual desktop,
              you will need to go back using "../"</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> mkdir </h4></li>
            <p> Stands for "make directory". This is used to create new folders in the unix code without having to go
              into the GUI and create a folder manually. Essentially, instead of taking a few click to make a folder in
              the GUI, we just write "mkdir (foldername)" and a folder will appear in that directory.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> cp </h4></li>
            <p> Stands for "copy". This command is used to copy files, groups of files, or directories. This requires
              you to have to directories, one where the computer is copying the directory, and the other to tell the
              computer where it is being copied to. To enable, do cp (file location you want to copy) (directory where
              you want to copy file to)
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> pwd </h4></li>
            <p> Stands for "print work directory". This will print the current directory that the user is in at the
              moment. Simply type in "pwd" into unix and the directory you are in will appear.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> v </h4></li>
            <p> Stands for "move". It will move one or more files, or a whole directory to another place of choice.
              Simply type in mv (file name you want to move) (directory you want to move the file to)
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> rm </h4></li>
            <p> Stands for "remote". This is used to delete files from the directory. Once deleted, you can not recover
              these files. To use the function type in rm (file name).
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> history </h4></li>
            <p> Used to show you the previous commands you made in terminal. You can scroll through the history using
              the up and down arrow keys.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Home directory </h4></li>
            <p> Repository for the the user's personal files. After logging into the system, this is usually where the
              user is. To see, easily just open command prompt or terminal and you will be right there. The tilde or ~
              is used to denote a user's home directoy. To operate, use ~/(file name).
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> File paths in linux </h4></li>
            <p> The human readable representation of a file or folder's location on the computer. We use these to find
              files and add data into them or remove data out of them.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Tab key </h4></li>
            <p> Convenient for completing file paths. If you know what the file starts with, you can type the first
              letter and then click tab to scroll through all the files that begin with that name. If you have no idea
              what's in that file, you can just keep clicking tab and it can show you the files in that directory.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Up and Down Arrow Keys </h4></li>
            <p> Used to circle through previous functions you typed into the cmd. This is convenient because you don't
              have to constantly keep typing the same command over and over again, instead you can circle through the
              commands and save time and errors. This is also a good tool to see where you went wrong when typing in a
              command. Simply use the arrow keys to show previously typed commands.

          Github Tutorial
        </h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Git tracks the changes of source code during the development process. This is important since all developers
          want to be aware of what changes occured by other developers, creating a clear communication between
          developers without them really having to speak to one another. Docker is an opensource that delivers software
          in containers. Automated testing is responsible for executing the commits, basically testing them to see if
          they work with the file. Essentially, it's a piece of software that tests other software to see if that
          software is playing nice with the other code. Continious Integration is the process of merging all of the
          branches several times a day to detect problems in the code early on so that when the code is towards it's
          finished product, developers don't have to waste time and look through each code to see where the problem lies.
          These aspects of github improbes productivity of a company since developers can constantly test if there code
          works with other developers code right then and there instead of waiting for the semi-finished product.
          Companies also gain a competitive advantage since developers are finding mistakes earlier rather than later,
          as well as on the same page everyday before the deadline.
